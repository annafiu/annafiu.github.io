                    <p>I've been blogging since 2012 when I still often went to the internet cafe. Initially because at that time I really liked Naruto anime and followed quite a lot of Facebook fanspage about Naruto. It turned out that the fanspage also created a blog whose contents were profiles of characters in Naruto, Jutsu's in Naruto, and other information about the world of Naruto. From there I was quite interested in blogs and the desire to create my own blog emerged.</p>

                    <p>The first blog that I made contains about the world of Naruto as well. Of course, all the content is the result of copy and paste, and you could say at that time I was quite "bar-bar" in taking posts from other blogs without including the source. As a result, after a year the blog was taken down and the google account I was using couldn't be used to create a new blog anymore.</p>

                    <p>OK, that was a bad experience. After that, at the end of 2013, I started blogging again with a new account (which I use until now). The content that I created first was also still copied and paste from other blogs, but this time I was more careful by including the source in each content. Then I tried to start creating my own content that discusses blogging. Starting from how to create a blog, blogger tutorials, to trying to make my own blog template to share.</p>

                    <p>After a long time, because I was bored, I became interested in the concept of "blogazine" (blog + magazine), which at that time was quite popular among Indonesian bloggers. If a regular blog displays written content with the same format on each page, a blog with a "blogazine" concept displays content with a different format on each page. The idea is to use the HTML edit feature on posts on blogger (actually not only the blogger platform, you can also use other platforms, but at that time the most widely used was blogger).</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
